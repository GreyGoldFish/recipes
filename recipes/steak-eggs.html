    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Steak, eggs and toast. Perfect for a weekend brunch!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>250g or heavier ribeye steak (if your steak is below this weight, skip the oven cooking part)</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 store-bought hash brown</li>
        <li>1 tomato cut in half or cherry tomatoes on the vine</li>
        <li>4-5 brown mushrooms, cleaned and de-stemmed</li>
        <li>½ tablespoon of butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by baking the hash brown according to the packaging (always go 5 mins longer to get them extra crispy)</li>
        <li>Rub the steak with oil and salt. Let it rest</li>
        <li>Wash and dry mushrooms and tomato</li>
        <li>3-5 minutes before hash browns are ready, set your pan on high heat</li>
        <li>Once hash brown is taken out, lower the oven temperature to 130ºC</li>
        <li>Place the tomato and mushrooms in the pan along with the steak. Sear both sides of the steak, one minute per side. Season vegetables and add olive oil</li>
        <li>Place in oven for 5-7 minutes (or until it reaches 60ºC for medium), take out the pan and place it on medium heat on the stove. Remove the steak and let it rest</li>
        <li>Add butter and eggs. Fit the hash browns on the side to heat up while cooking</li>
        <li>Season the eggs and take them off of the heat before fully cooked</li>
        <li>Serve with a slice of toasted bread (dark or sourdough bread recommended)</li>
    </ol>
